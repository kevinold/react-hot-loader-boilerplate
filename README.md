# react-hot-loader-boilerplate

Full featured boilerplate integrating gaearon's [react-hot-loader 3 beta](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/) 

includes:
- react
- redux
- react-router
- react-router-redux
- webpack production/dev builds
- mocha
- eslint
- babel
- sass

I borrowed the demo application from [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) and updated it to work with RHL. I added a few things that I needed (react-router-redux and console logging middleware) that aren't found in react-slingshot


### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


Enjoy.
