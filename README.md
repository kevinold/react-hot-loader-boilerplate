# react-hot-loader-boilerplate

Full featured boilerplate integrating gaearon's [react-hot-loader 3 beta](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/) 

includes:
- react
- redux
- react-router
- react-router-redux
- webpack production/dev builds
- mocha
- eslint
- babel
- sass

I borrowed the demo application from (react-slingshot)[https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot] and updated it to work with RHL.

Enjoy.
